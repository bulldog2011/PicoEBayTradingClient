 Second chance offer made to a non-winning bidder on an ended listing.
 A seller can make an offer to a non-winning bidder when either the winning bidder
 has failed to pay for an item or the seller has a duplicate of the item.
 A seller can create a Second Chance Offer immediately after a listing ends and up to
 60 days after the end of the listing. eBay does not charge an Insertion Fee,
 but if the bidder accepts the offer, the regular Final Value Fee is charged.
 In the case of an Unpaid Item, the seller should ensure that everything has
 been done to resolve the issue with the winning bidder before sending a
 Second Chance Offer to another bidder. See the Unpaid Items Process for details.
 Make sure you're aware of other rules and restrictions surrounding Second Chance Offers.
 Use AddSecondChanceItem to submit Second Chance Offers.
