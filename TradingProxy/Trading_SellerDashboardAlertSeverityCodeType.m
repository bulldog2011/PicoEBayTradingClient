 The alert message is informational in nature.
 <br><br>
 Some examples: you might get a PowerSeller status message if your PowerSeller
 level has been increased, a policy-compliance message if you have no recent
 policy violations, a buyer-satisfaction message if you are providing excellent
 customer service, or a seller-account message if there is a new notice available
 about your payment status.

 The alert message is a warning that identifies a problem.
 <br><br>
 For example, you might get a PowerSeller status warning if you missed the
 PowerSeller sales requirements in the past month. Or you might get a
 policy-compliance warning if you recently listed an item with excessive
 shipping costs, or a seller-account warning if a collections message
 asks you to pay now to make sure no restrictions are placed on your account.

 The alert message is a strong warning that indicates a serious problem.

 For example, you might get a PowerSeller status strong warning if you have lost
 your PowerSeller status because of policy violations, or you might get a
 policy-compliance strong warning if your account has been restricted.
