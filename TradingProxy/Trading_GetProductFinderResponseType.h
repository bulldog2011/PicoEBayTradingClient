/**
 
 
 A string containing a list of search attributes that can be used in a
 "Product Finder" style query, along with related meta-data. The meta-data
 specifies possible values of each attribute, the logic for presenting
 attributes to a user, and rules for validating the user's selections. For
 backward compatibility, this data is in the same XML format that was used
 in the Legacy XML API so that you can apply the same Product Finder XSL
 stylesheet to it. That is, individual elements are not described using the
 new eBay XML schema format. For information about each element in the
 ProductFinderData string, see the product finder model documentation in
 the eBay Web Services guide (see links below).<br>
 <br>
 Because this is returned as a string, the XML markup is escaped with
 character entity references (e.g., &amp;lt;eBay&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ProductFinders&amp;gt;...).
 See the appendices in the eBay Web Services guide for general information about
 string data types.
