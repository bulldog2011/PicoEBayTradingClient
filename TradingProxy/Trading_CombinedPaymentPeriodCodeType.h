 This enumerated type contains the list of values that can be used by the seller to set
 the number of days after item purchase that an unpaid order can be combined with one
 or more other mutual (same buyer and same seller) unpaid orders into one "Combined
 Payment" order. Either the buyer or the seller can initiate the Combined Payment
