 Specifies a predefined subset of fields to return. The predefined set of fields
 can vary for different calls. Only applicable to certain calls (see request types
 that include a GranularityLevel property). For calls that support this filter, see
 the eBay Web Services guide for a list of the output fields that are returned for
 each level. Only one level can be specified at a time. For GetSellerList, use
 DetailLevel or GranularityLevel in a given request, but not both. For
 GetSellerList, if GranularityLevel is specified, DetailLevel is ignored.
