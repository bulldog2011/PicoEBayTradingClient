 For GetProducts, the number of products found in the domain
 (characteristic set or attribute set). If a product is mapped
 to more than one domain, it will be counted separately for each
 domain. (For example, if the same product can be found in both
 Children's Books and Fiction Books, the count for both of these
 domains will include that product.)
 Furthermore, when a product is mapped to more than one domain,
 Product.AttributeSetID only returns the most applicable domain,
 as determined by eBay.
