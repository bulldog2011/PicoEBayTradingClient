/**
 
 Search for listings based on the sale record ID.
 When an item is sold, Selling Manager generates a sale record.
 A sale record contains buyer information, shipping, and other information.
 A sale record is displayed in the Sold view in Selling Manager.
 In the following calls,
 the value for the sale record ID is in the SellingManagerSalesRecordNumber field:
 GetItemTransactions, GetSellerTransactions, GetOrders, GetOrderTransactions.
 In the Selling Manager calls, the value for the sale record ID is in the
 SaleRecordID field. The sale record ID can be for a single or multiple line item order.
 <br/><br/>
 For orders that occurred within the last 30 days, passing only the SaleRecordID into the GetSellingManagerSoldListings
 request will return the sale record. However, for sales that occurred more than 30 days ago, the SaleDateRange container
 must also be used, passing in a date range that includes the date on which the specific sale occurred.
