 Enumerated type that contains all possible reasons why the buyer's payment for
 the order is being held by PayPal instead of being distributed to the seller's
 account. A seller's funds for an order can be held by PayPal for as little as
 three days after the buyer receives the order, but the hold can be up to 21
 days based on the scenario, and in some cases, the seller's lack of action in
 helping to expedite the release of funds.
