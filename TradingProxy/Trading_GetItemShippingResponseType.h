 Shipping-related details for the specified item. Any error about shipping services
 (returned by a vendor of eBay's who calculates shipping costs) is returned in
 ShippingRateErrorMessage. Errors from a shipping service are likely to be related to
 issues with shipping specifications, such as package size and the selected shipping
 method not supported by a particular shipping service.

 If a buyer buys multiple quantities of an item and the resultant total
 weight exceeds the weight limit of the shipping service, GetItemShipping
 returns the shipping cost and shipping service and internally groups the
 items in separate packages. A shipping service is removed from
 ShippingDetails only if the weight of a single item exceeds the weight
 limit of the shipping service.
