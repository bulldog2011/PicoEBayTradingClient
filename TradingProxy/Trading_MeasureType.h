/**
 
 Basic type for specifying measures and the system of measurement.
 A decimal value (e.g., 10.25) is meaningful
 as a measure when accompanied by a definition of the unit of measure (e.g., Pounds),
 in which case the value specifies the quantity of that unit.
 A MeasureType expresses both the value (a decimal) and, optionally, the unit and
 the system of measurement.
 Details such as shipping weights are specified as measure types.
