 If a seller offers an item for less than the Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) of
 that item, the seller cannot show the actual discounted price on the view item
 page. The buyer must open a pop-up on view item page or the discount price will
 be shown during checkout. MinimumAdvertisedPriceExposure provides enums for
 specifying how the buyer is to view the discounted price, either PreCheckout or
 DuringCheckout. This is applicable for MAP items only.
