 There are three categories of error: request errors, application errors,
 and system errors. Request and application errors are often caused by
 passing invalid data in the request. System errors are primarily caused by
 application failures and cannot be corrected by changing request values.

 application can retry the request as-is a reasonable number of times
 (eBay recommends twice). If the error persists, contact Developer
 Technical Support. Once the problem has been resolved, the request may be

 request is missing a required data element or it contains an invalid
 field. The problem must be corrected before the request can be resent.
 Inspect the error message to find the cause of the problem. If the
 problem is due to an application error, modify the application and resend
 the request. If the error is due to invalid data, the source of the data
 must be corrected before you resend the resend request to eBay.
