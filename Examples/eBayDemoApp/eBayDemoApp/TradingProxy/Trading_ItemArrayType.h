/**
 
 Contains the data properties that define one item listing. GetSellerEvents and
 GetSellerList only return items if any are available for the seller within the
 time window specified in the request.<br>
 <br>
 Some optional fields are only returned if the seller defined them for the
 item. Some fields are only returned under particular conditions specified in
 the individual field descriptions. For example, a buyer's contact information
 might only be returned if the member who is making the request (as identified
 in eBayAuthToken) has an order relationship with that buyer. <br>
 <br>
 For calls that support detail levels, the set of fields returned is also
 controlled by the value of DetailLevel in the request. For some calls, other
 parameters in the request can also control the data returned for each item.
 For example, GranularityLevel controls the fields to return for each item in
 the GetSellerList response.
