 If you don't pass PayPal in the listing request but the seller's eBay
 preferences are set to accept PayPal on all listings,
 eBay will add PayPal as a payment method for you in most cases,
 and we may return a warning. <br>
 <br>
 PayPal must be accepted when the seller requires immediate payment
 (Item.AutoPay) or offers other PayPal-based features, such as a
 finance offer (Item.FinanceOfferID).
 PayPal must be accepted for charity listings.
 PayPal must be accepted for event ticket listings when the venue is in
 New York state or Illinois, so that eBay can offer buyer protection
 (per state law). (For some applications, it may be
 simplest to use errors returned from VerifyAddItem to flag the PayPal
 requirement for New York and Illinois ticket listings.)
 PayPal must be accepted for US eBay Motors listings that require a deposit (and it will not be set automatically based on the
 seller's preferences). Conversely, if PayPal is specified for US eBay Motors listings, deposit attributes must be specified.<br>
 <br>
 For additional information about features that depend on PayPal,
