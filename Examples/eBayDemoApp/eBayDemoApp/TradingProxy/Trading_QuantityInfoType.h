/**
 
 Enables you (the seller) to avoid being left with 1 item in your
 listing. A typical use case is event tickets in reserved,
 adjacent seats, or items that typically only sell if more than
 1 can be purchased at once. <br>
 <br>
 Specify the minimum number of items that
 should remain if a buyer doesn't purchase all the items.
 Based on the value of MinimumRemnantSet and the listing's
 available quantity (Quantity-QuantitySold), eBay calculates how many
 items a buyer can purchase.
 For example, suppose you list 5 tickets, and you want at least
 2 tickets remaining for the final buyer to purchase.
 In this case, you would set MinimumRemnantSet to 2.
 This means a buyer can purchase 1, 2, 3, or 5 tickets, but not 4
 (because 4 would leave the seller with 1 ticket).<br>
 <br>
 To remove this restriction when you revise or relist,
 set MinimumRemnantSet to 1.<br>
 <br>
 Applicable to multi-quantity, fixed-price listings.
 Currently supported for US and CA event ticket listings.
