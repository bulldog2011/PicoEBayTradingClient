/**
 
  This field indicates the type and amount of the refund to the buyer involved in
  an DE/AT order order subject to the new eBay payment process. The <strong>type</strong>
  attribute indicates whether the refund is being applied against the purchase price or
  the shipping price. Using the <strong>issueRefund</strong> call of the
  Order Adjustment API, the seller can also issue an optional/additional refund that
  does not apply to the purchase price or shipping price.
  The <strong>type</strong> values are defined in the
  <strong>RefundLineTypeCodeType</strong> enumeration type.<br/><br/>
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>RefundLine</strong> fields will only be returned if a refund
  has been issued from the seller to the buyer for a DE/AT order going through the new
  eBay payment process.
